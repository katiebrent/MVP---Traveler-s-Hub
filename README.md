Traveler's Hub

Sub-Heading
Where you can keep track of where you've been, and plan your next trip by connecting with those who have been there!

Summary
This app gives the user the ability to keep track of the countries they've been to and see it visualized in a list and a map. Additionally, the user keeps track of the relative budget of the experience in each country. That way when other users are searching for people who have been to a given country, they can get an idea of who to go to for advice based on the kind of trip they are looking for.

Problem
I am part of a group called Girls Love Travel on Facebook, and every day there are multiple people posting "has anyone been to X country and can give me advice?".

Solution
Rather than having to send an open ended question and maybe get responses back that are not appropriate for your planned experience and/or budget, you can source the people who to ask through this app!

Quote from You
Travel is the ultimate way to connect through stories and life changing experiences.
